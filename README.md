# Project Management Project with MERN Stack & GraphQL
Building this project really helped me digest how the frontend and backend communicate. Before this project, I've only been focusing on each end seperately. So I decided to take on the challenge of **implementing everything I've learned so far and combine it together.**
## Reasoning for this project
The orginal reason was to learn GraphQL because I wanted to add another tool in my toolbox and I'm glad I took upon the challenge of also doing a full MERN app as well.
### Useful resources for this project
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) - I really loved how Apollo orginized and explained their documentation.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) - I wished that the GraphQL team would show better examples in using their Javascript library.
